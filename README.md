## Project Description

### Overview:

#### What is the Pig Game Dice Roller?

The game has 2 players, playing in rounds:

- In each turn, a player rolls the dice as many times as they wish. Each result get added to the player's **ROUND** score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all of the points in the player's **ROUND** score is lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that their ROUND score gets added to their **GLOBAL** score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach 100 points in their **GLOBAL** score wins the game

### Challenges:

The challenge was to only use Vanilla JS to construct this game and understand how to do basic DOM manipulation.
